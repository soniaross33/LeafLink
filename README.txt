(1) - Instructions to run the program:

Download the project files to your computer.

Ensure all project files (index.html, style.css, app.js, scrollFade.js, and the images folder) are in the same directory.

Because the project uses Firebase, you must run it using a local server.

In VS Code, install the Live Server extension.

Right-click index.html and select "Open with Live Server".

The app will open in your browser and automatically load sitter requests data from Firebase. Success!
